# ArpSpoofDetectorProject
My first attempt at a python project: Arp Spoof Detector Program

I am a beginning a long and hard journey with this post into python programming and I hope to be able to contribute to the community, this is my first of many; I opted to not use scapy and purely focus and the fundamentals that I knew at the time. I hope that any and all readers will provide their input and advice whenever possible and I thank you in advance. I will be making updates to this project as time progresses.

Upcominig Update: The program will only check one interface on the host machine to increase accuracy of duplicates found and avoid possible false positives.
